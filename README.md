Under Releases, download the correct version for your java version. I.e. If you have JDK/JRE 13, download the .jar file under the release
specifically for JDK 13.

Once downloaded, open a command prompt (windows) or terminal (linux, macOS):

1. Change directory to the downloaded file
2. Input the command "java -jar <name of .jar file>" where name of .jar file is the jar file you downloaded from the release tab.

The jar files are cross-platform (All jars work on the mainstream OSes: Windows, MacOS, Linux).
NOT forward compatible in terms of JDK versions. 
i.e. You downloaded the .jar for JDK13, but you attempt to run the jar program with JDK8/1.8 on your computer. It will not work.
